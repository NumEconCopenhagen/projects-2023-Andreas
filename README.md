This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project: Simulations of a model of labor supply within a household - market work as well as house work.
2. Data project: Using data from Statistics Denmark, I analyze the relationship between the wage sum and personal income taxes.
3. Model project. Simulations of a Ramsey model with hand-to-mouth households. Convergence speed to steady state varies for different shares of hand-to-mouth households.
