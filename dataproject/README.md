# Data analysis project

This project contains a *very simple* data analysis that investigates the empirical relationship between the Danish wage sum (loosly speaking the sum of all Danish wages before taxes), and the government revenue from personal income taxes. The hypothesis is that there is a positive correlation between the two variables, as it is fair to assume that a large part of the personal income tax revenue stems from wages ("A-indkomst").

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. LOENSUM.xlsx (*Statistics Denmark*) 
1. SKAT.xlsx (*Statistics Denmark*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project does not require any packages.
