# Model analysis project

The project is titled **Ramsey model with hand-to-mouth households** and explores how the convergence speed to steady state varies for different shares of hand-to-mouth households. The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Ramsey.ipynb](Ramsey.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
